# MERN E-commerce Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack e-commerce application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides a platform for online shopping with features such as product browsing, cart management, user authentication, and order processing.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of this application:

[MERN E-commerce Live Demo]([(https://spiffy-boba-44d8d6.netlify.app))]

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Styling**: CSS Modules or Styled Components (specify which one you're using)
- **Deployment**: Netlify (frontend), Heroku (backend)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- MongoDB (v4 or later)

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-mern.git
   cd ecommerce-mern
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

   Create a `.env` file in the server directory with the following content:

   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
   ```

   Replace `your_jwt_secret_here` with a secure random string.

3. **Set up the frontend**

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

   Create a `.env` file in the client directory with the following content:

   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

4. **Start the application**

   In one terminal, start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

   In another terminal, start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

   The application should now be running, with the backend on `http://localhost:5000` and the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.

This updated README.md now includes a section for the live demo link, which you can update with your actual Netlify deployment URL. It also includes information about the deployment process, which can be helpful for users who want to deploy their own version of the application.

Remember to replace "https://your-netlify-link-here.netlify.app" with your actual Netlify deployment URL once you have it.
